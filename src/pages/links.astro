## Genre Fiction

"Read what you love until you love to read" — Naval

Sure, genre fiction might not be the most intellectually nourishing material, but it helped
me get into reading, and for that I am forever grateful. In fact, the first book I
remember reading is Harry Potter during my first year at the University of Chicago.
Below are some titles that helped me create a reading habit.

# Gear

## Everyday Carry

- [Aer City Pack Pro](https://www.aersf.com/city-pack-pro-black)
